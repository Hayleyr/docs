## Summary

In this tutorial we will import a set of polygons and create a map. Next, we will walk you through the simple steps of adding labels to your polygons based on attributes in your table. We will cover some of the custom styling options for your labels. When we hit a limitation of the wizards, we will take a look at how simple it is to edit CartoCSS to get exactly what we want from our label styles.
